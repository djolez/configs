# We need a sleep here since the button triggers a few more key codes. 
# It also triggers Control+Mod2+Control_L and Alt+Mod2+Alt_L. The sleep       
# prevents that X receives those keypresses simultaniously. Therefore they    
# might interfere and trigger unwanted actions. By the sleep we make sure that
# the Alt+Left is receive as distinct event.
